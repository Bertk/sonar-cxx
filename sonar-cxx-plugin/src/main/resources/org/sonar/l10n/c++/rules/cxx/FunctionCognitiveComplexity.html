<p>Cognitive Complexity score is assessed according to three basic rules:
  <ol>
    <li>Ignore structures that allow multiple statements to be readably shorthanded into one</li>
    <li>Increment (add one) for each break in the linear flow of the code</li>
    <li>Increment when flow-breaking structures are nested</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>Additionally, a complexity score is made up of four different types of increments:
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Nesting - assessed for nesting control flow structures inside each other</li>
    <li>Structural - assessed on control flow structures that are subject to a nesting increment, and that increase the nesting
      count
    </li>
    <li>Fundamental - assessed on statements not subject to a nesting increment</li>
    <li>Hybrid - assessed on control flow structures that are not subject to a nesting increment, but which do increase the nesting
      count
    </li>
  </ol>
