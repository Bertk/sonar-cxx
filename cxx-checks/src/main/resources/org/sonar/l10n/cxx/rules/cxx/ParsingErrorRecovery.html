<p>
When the C++ parser fails, it is possible to record the failure as a violation on the file.
This way it is not only possible to keep track of the number of files that are not parsed, it is also easy to find out why they cannot be parsed.

<p>
This rule creates an issue when automatic error recovery has occurred after a parsing error and parsing has continued.
In case of error recovery code is skipped and not analyzed.

This does not affect the results of issues imported via external tools. However, rules or software metrics checked by the CXX plugin may be inaccurate.
